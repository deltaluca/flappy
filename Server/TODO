Things that will need to be done on the
server-side

a) Functions that will implement the 
   complex move rules of 'Diplomacy'. Once a move request
   respects the syntax of DAIDE, it is valid by definition.
   The game state is updated accordingly and the game
   is continued in the next round if the winning condition is not met.

b) Function that implement the register, login-procedure and modify
   profile details of a player.
