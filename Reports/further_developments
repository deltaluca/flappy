Our further developments include more research and testing into AI's and more
advanced ways to do negotiation. Due to time constraints in testing and due to 
the large game space and the amount of time needed for a game of Diplomacy we 
have not been able to explore as many routes as we would have liked. For example:
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Improvements to pattern weights (and learnbot) as described in 
Ari Shapiro's paper on pattern weights, for example future patterns to take 
into account specific locations of other pieces.
\item Perform temporal difference learning of games played by humans and store 
that knowledge in a pattern-weight database. We could not do this as we do not have 
support for human players on our user client.
\item Extend the user client to allow a human user to play Diplomacy with a 
tutorial to aid new players and create a well designed UI.
\item To be able to optimise negotiation features, like when the best time to 
backstab is, this is one of the most important aspects of the game and makes 
the difference between winning or losing.
\end{enumerate}
