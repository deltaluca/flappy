the diagram here (which we have nicknamed our onion) describes our approach 
towards building our AI bots, the layers represent more functionality as we 
go outwards, but not necessarily representing encapsulation of features of 
inner layers. In addition our SkelBot (Skeleton for all bots which handles 
communication between server and bot) is not shown here as it is used throughout 
and provides functionality for all the bots 
HoldBot is the most basic of bots, in that it only holds for all orders. 
RandomBot builds upon this by generating all possible and valid moves 
(including supports) and chooses one randomly.
DumbBot is designed as a bot with fairly good strategy which uses a proximity 
algorithm to calculate a value for each province, ranks the provinces and using 
a combination of other heuristics picks a suggested move.
CoverBot and LearnBot are within the same layer as they do not add functionality 
to one another but rather explores two different ways to improving Diplomacy AI.
CoverBot uses a shortest path algorithm (using the Floyd Warshall 
algorithm) to implement a search tree which finds a shortest path in a weighted 
graph to find a good move.
LearnBot uses a database of Pattern Weights which learns during and after a game 
which moves lead to good results and stores their weightings in a database, 
therefore this bot 'learns' to play the game better as it goes along.
NegotiationBot is our final bot which adds on negotiation functionality on 
another bot. Specifically this negotiation consists of storing values in a 
database which try to mimick human-like qualities of character traits, 
emotion and relationships between other bots.
