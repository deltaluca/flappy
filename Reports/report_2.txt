Report Two: Progress & Revisions â€” due: 12.00 11th November 2011

This report has four aims:


Progress: to report on the progress of the project so far.

   [ It should detail how many iterations and what requirements or features have   been completed so far. Also include what problems - technical or other - have been encountered and what measures have been taken to mitigate their effect on overall success. ]


Revisions: to record any changes to any of the five items in Report One.

     [ You are expected to include appropriate elements of Report One to highlight any changes made.

        Have key requirements changed, been deleted or added? If so, has this been cleared by your project supervisor?
        Have your infrastrucutre needs changed?
        Do you still plan the same feature extensions?
        Have you changed how you measure progress?
        Are there problems that threaten completion of core functionality?
        How many iterations do you still plan?
        Also present a revised, less speculative schedule. ]

    
People management: to document any issues that may have emerged in the work dynamics of your group

       [ How do you cope with the fact that group members have different levels or areas of skills?
        how do you ensure that all group members contribute fairly
        How do you resolve any problems? ]

    
Ethical and Environmental Impact:

        Discuss whether your project has any potential ethical issues and explain how you intend to address such issues in your design, implementation, deployment or work practice,
        Assess the environmental impact of your to-be-deployed system; describe ways in which this impact can be limited without compromising key requirements, or argue why the environmental impact cannot be decreased without such compromise.

Evaluation Criteria for Report Two: the same as for Report One. But keep in mind that change and its management are the norm, not the exception.
