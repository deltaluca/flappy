	computational players for two-player games, such as Chess,
	
	the multi-player domain is not as well explored. We make
	
	an attempt to apply a multi-agent approach to a multiplayer
	
	game with huge search spaces and multiple adversaries,

	against other available bots in an open competition and show
	
	that our solution outperforms its competitors in score while
	
	being competitive in speed.},

  pages = {255-281},
  abstract = {The area of automated negotiation has been of particular interest
	in
	
	artificial intelligence due to the important role negotiation plays
	in facilitating
	
	understanding and achieving co-operation among entities with differing
	interests.
	
	These entities may be individuals, organizations, governments, or
	automated
	
	agents. This paper presents methods for solving different aspects
	of automated
	
	negotiation: with whom to negotiate, evaluation of suggestions and
	the way to
	
	offer suggestions. These methods were successfully used to develop
	the system
	
	Diplomat, that may be one of the players in a board game, Diplomacy.
	This
	
	game is characterized by intense negotiation, a very large set of
	possible strategies
	
	and the absence of a trusted intermediary. Although Diplomacy players
	may
	
	break their promises, close co-operation is needed for a success},
